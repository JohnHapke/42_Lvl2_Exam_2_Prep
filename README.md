# 42_Exam_2_Prep

## Purpose
> This repository serves as a preparation hub for the 42 Exam Rank 2. The goal is to practice and master the types of problems that might appear in the exam by coding various exercises and challenges in C. These exercises focus on improving problem-solving skills, understanding of C programming concepts, and time management under exam-like conditions. By working through these tasks, I aim to solidify my knowledge of memory management, string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking, all of which are critical for success in the Rank 2 exam.

## Exam Tasks

Below is a list of tasks I encountered and solved during the actual Rank 2 exam. Each task represents a problem I tackled, along with a brief description of its requirements. The solutions can be found in the respective source files in this repository.
